## üöÄ High Priority Features

### 1. Per-Island Adaptive Thresholds
**Status:** üí° Idea
**Complexity:** Medium
**Impact:** High

Allow different early exit thresholds based on island size:
```javascript
const threshold = calculateThreshold(islandArea);
// Large islands (1000+): 500 attempts
// Medium islands (100-500): 300 attempts
// Small islands (20-100): 150 attempts
```

**Benefits:**
- More efficient packing on small islands (don't waste attempts)
- More thorough packing on large islands (worth the patience)
- Better overall coverage (estimated +2-3%)

**Implementation:**
- Add `adaptiveThresholdMode` option: 'fixed' | 'scaled'
- Create threshold scaling function based on island area
- Update console logging to show threshold per island

---

### 2. Hexagonal Shape Support
**Status:** üí° Idea
**Complexity:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

Add hexagons as a shape option for tighter packing in certain regions.

**Benefits:**
- Hexagons tile better than circles (honeycomb packing)
- Potential +5-10% coverage in regular regions
- Unique aesthetic

**Implementation:**
- Add hexagon rendering to `packing.js` `drawShapes()`
- Add hexagon collision detection (6-sided polygon)
- Add area calculation: `(3 * sqrt(3) / 2) * r^2`

**Considerations:**
- Hexagons harder to pack in irregular boundaries
- May need orientation randomization

---
