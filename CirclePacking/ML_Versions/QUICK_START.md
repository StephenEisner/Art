# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - Circle Packing v11

## What's New in This Version?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Five Budgeting Schemes
Choose how packing attempts are distributed across islands:
- **Fair Share** - Balanced (default, reliable)
- **Proportional** - Large islands get proportionally more
- **Weighted** - Large islands get 2x their share
- **Fixed + Bonus** - Every island gets 1000 minimum
- **Exponential** - Sqrt scaling (best for varied sizes)

## 2-Minute Better Results

1. Upload your image
2. **Adjust clusters** based on your image:
   - Simple image? **15-30 clusters**
   - Complex image? **40-60 clusters**
   - Very detailed? **60-80 clusters**

3. **Choose budgeting scheme:**
   - Not sure? Keep **Fair Share** ‚úì
   - Landscape photo? Try **Proportional**
   - Portrait photo? Try **Fixed + Bonus**

4. **Set attempts** based on clusters:
   - < 30 clusters: **10,000 attempts**
   - 30-60 clusters: **15,000 attempts**
   - > 60 clusters: **20,000-30,000 attempts**

5. Generate ‚Üí Save Image ‚Üí Save Settings

## 5-Minute Optimization

### Step 1: Generate Baseline
```
Clusters: 30
Budgeting: Fair Share
Max Attempts: 10,000
```
Click Generate ‚Üí Check console (F12) for coverage %

### Step 2: Analyze Console Output
Look for:
- **Coverage:** Should be 55-70%
- **Islands skipped:** Should be 0
- **Island breakdown:** How many tiny/small/medium/large?

### Step 3: Adjust Based on Results

**If coverage is LOW (< 50%):**
- Reduce clusters to 20-30, OR
- Increase attempts to 15,000, OR
- Change budgeting to Proportional

**If "islands skipped" > 0:**
- Increase attempts to 15,000+, OR
- Change budgeting to Fixed + Bonus

**If you have many tiny islands (100+):**
- Reduce clusters to 30-40, OR
- Use Fixed + Bonus budgeting, OR
- Increase attempts to 20,000+

### Step 4: Fine-Tune
Try these advanced features:
- ‚úì Enable Multi-Pass (better coverage)
- ‚úì Enable Gap Filling (fills tiny gaps)
- ‚úì Enable Mixed Shapes (rectangles help elongated areas)

### Step 5: Save Everything!
- Save your final image
- Save your settings for next time

## Troubleshooting

### "Processing is too slow"
- Reduce Processing Size to 300px
- Reduce Max Attempts to 8,000
- Disable Multi-Pass

### "Islands skipped in console"
- Increase Max Attempts
- OR change to Fixed + Bonus budgeting

### "Coverage is too low"
- Reduce cluster count to 20-30
- OR increase Max Attempts to 15,000+
- OR change to Proportional budgeting

### "Tiny details are missing"
- Use Fixed + Bonus budgeting
- Increase Max Attempts to 20,000+
- Enable Gap Filling

### "Large areas look sparse"
- Use Proportional or Weighted budgeting
- OR reduce cluster count

## Understanding the Console

Press F12 to open browser console. You'll see:

```
üéØ Using budgeting scheme: FAIR SHARE

Cluster 5/30: 8000 pixels in 23 island(s)
  üí∞ Budget: FAIR SHARE - 10,000 attempts for 23 islands
  
  Island 1/23: 2400px ‚Üí FULL_PACK ‚Üí 950 attempts ‚Üí 245 shapes ‚Üí 68.2%
  Island 2/23: 800px ‚Üí SMALL_PACK ‚Üí 340 attempts ‚Üí 98 shapes ‚Üí 62.1%
  ...
  
  üìä CLUSTER 5 SUMMARY:
     Islands filled: 23 (100.0%) ‚úì GOOD!
     Islands skipped: 0 ‚úì GOOD!
     Cluster coverage: 65.7%
```

**What to check:**
- ‚úì Islands skipped: 0 = Good!
- ‚úì Cluster coverage: 55-70% = Good!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Islands skipped: > 0 = Increase attempts or use Fixed + Bonus
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Coverage: < 50% = Too many clusters or not enough attempts
